# Finance-Blog-with-EJS-and-Node-JS

<h3>Function & Description:</h3>
This is a to-do app I built for my friend to keep track of the things she needs to do. It's written in JavaScript, CSS and HTML code and allows her filter tasks by categories (all tasks, completed, unfinished). I also added some animation for when she deletes or crosses out finished tasks.

I also coded it to save undeleted items to the local storage. So, if you refresh, the tasks are still there and once you delete a task, it does not reappear.

**Issues Faced & Solution***:
I needed to find a way to get parameter routing to work even when the cases of blog titles do not match. I was ablt to do this by installing thr Lodash JavaScript library and using the lowerCase method.
