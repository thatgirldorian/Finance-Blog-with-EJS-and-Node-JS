# Finance-Blog-with-EJS-and-Node-JS

<h3>Function & Description:</h3>
This is a woman-centered finance blog. It's a web app that allows the admin/user to write and read blog posts. It shows a truncated version of the post on the homepage. However, the individual blog posts can also be clicked on to go to a dynamic page.

<h3>Issue Faced & Solution:</h3>
I needed to find a way to get parameter routing to work even when the cases of blog titles do not match (for instance, lower case vs kebab case). I was able to do this by installing the Lodash JavaScript library and using the lowercase method.

<h3>Technology Used:</h3>

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- EJS
- Lodash library
- Node JS
- Express JS
- Heroku
